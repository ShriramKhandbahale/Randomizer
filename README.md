# Ramdomizer
<span>- Make the right decisions</span>

## Introduction
Ramdomizer is a simple web application created for fun,
it has a 'Coin Toss' and a 'Spin Wheel' feature where you can add or remove items form the list and it will randomly select any one on each spin. This could be useful for making quick decisions or just playing simple games among your peers.

> ###### We know that this app is stupid, but we created it anyway because we often struggle with decision-making and this actually has been quite helpful
